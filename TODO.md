# project

## basic idea:

i reckon our best bet is to focus what we're going to creat around the requestites
the main one being two API usages:
the go to idea i can see is a dashboard for users that they're gonna want to keep open throughout the day. i know things i keep open throughout the day whilst on my PC is:
- a to do list (site functionality made with JS, main reason of webpage, ticks basic html, bootstrap, css, js usage, alongside cleint storage. could make this a dumbed down version of a previous challenge, maybe make buttons that are added to a list from a text box adding to the list, when the created button is clicked maybe deletes, and add an empty all button)
- music (maybe spotify that links a lo-fi playlist you can stop, play and skip. adds user experience and keeps people using the page in the backgorund
https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-09-04/how-to-embed-spotifys-play-button/
pretty basic to do
)
* maybe add things like weather API, time and date for an updating clock on page API and basic news search API (ticks the boxes for all API and creates a basic
- we could either do time with dayjs or something new and hook it up to a working clock
- then add simple functionality from the previous project we just did for weather API and make a dumbed down section of the challenge we just did
- then finally a small section that gives you the latest trending 5 news articles when a button is clicked, or lets you search latest news for a specific term with a maximum of 5 so this feels like an extra small feature)
that way the project covers all the criteria innately and gives a fully functioning dashboard site people have a reason to use and a user friendly site.

## in depth description with design:

to start we could make a basic webpage through html with:

- section occupying the whole span of page with a welcome message to the dashboard and a widget for the spotify play pause for a chill playlist (and have one of us focusing on that until we've got functionality, so that's 1/5 people occupied until working, this is a quick and easy one that should only take a cuple hours to get working)

- section for day printed in words, military time, date in xx/xx/xxxx format, with a clock beneath that updates realtime every second, beneath welcome message and spotify play (and have one of us focusing on that until we've got functionality, so that's 2/5 people occupied until working)

- section for weather next to time section that lets you search for one city with current eweather that updates every search and refreshes every 20 minutes using previous search, add saved searches for 3 buttons and deletes oldest one on new search, with a section for the next 7 days weather, displaying today to same day of the next week in smaller cmpared to todays weather (and have one of us focusing on that until we've got functionality, so that's 3/5 people occupied until working)

* we could have those previous two sections on the top of the page under a header and the first welcome section with the music play area, with the previous two sections occupying, maybe 1/3 of the visible page upon refresh, and have the time section occupying 1/3 of the vertical space and the weather section the other 2/3, giving us maybe a total of 2/3 of the visible page without scroll currently in use. (and have one of us focusing on that until we've got functionality, so that's 4/5 people occupied until working)

- section for to do list occupying 1/2 of the vertical space that autogenerates as needed below everything mentioned, make buttons that are added to a list from a text box adding to the list, when the created button is clicked deletes, and add an empty all button next to and add from text box button, all autogenerated below this.(and have one of us focusing on that until we've got functionality, so that's 5/5 people occupied until working, )

- section for news ocuppying 1/2 of vertical space next to the to do list that gives you the latest trending 5 news articles and refresh when a button is clicked, or lets you search latest news for a specific term with a maximum of 5 so this feels like an extra small feature. (and have the two of us that were doing the time section and header/ spotify section make a start on this because they'll be done a lot quicker, working together. focusing on that until we've got functionality)

## final decision

an app that calls two APIs, one for films, one for recipies. Recommends food and films based on search criteria with a user friendly UI and intuitive UX for people that are indecisive on what to cook and watch.

    project management:
    structure:
        HTML structure (bones)
        folder structure and linking things to work in tandem

    git:
        permissions
        basic repo
        push pull
        merge conflicts

    debugging and support with CSS and APIs/JS:
        familiarise self with both APIs and code structures
        add general JS as necessary
        flutter between CSS and API js towards end of the project to add functionality

    CSS #1:
        mock up of styling and structure of page
        mock up including color schemes
        keeping a list of classes and ID's generated in API team (with what does what and is what element, with ideas of what to apply where)
        applying CSS to make a clean and polished end product and maintaining order to the page as a whole

        move towards JS and API work to implement extra functionality after initial API phase complete

    Recipie API:
        familiarisation of basic documentation and usage
        get calls needed for 3 main searches
        structure of output
        what autogen JS code will be done to apply to html
        Coordinate with other API dev on standard structure Output to help with CSS structure
        local storage use for saved buttons
        local storage used for display most recent on page refresh

        move towards CSS and visual aspect after team swap towards end
